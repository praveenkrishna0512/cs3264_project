We will later use these facts to construct a reasonable baseline model which chooses the most frequently assigned grade in each category. The fact that our dataset is very imbalanced with respect to very low and very high grades leads us to use a stratified train-test-split later on. "

    "After comparing the average RSME of all these models we settled on the SVM model with RBF kernel. We also adapted a LSTM CNN model made publicly availabe on Kaggle in another notebook called LSTM.ipynb in the same directory. The SVM model also outperformed this model. For these comparisons the metric used was lowest average RSME, one of our key performance indicators. \n",

    "We then made another attempt at engineering a feature to try to improve the SVM model. The idea was to compute the frequency of each word that appears in the corpus (ignoring stop words) and then something together 1/(frequency) of these scores to give a higher weighting to more rare words. One issue with this idea is that many words appeared as being infrequent because they were misspelled. So we first spell-corrected the words and then computed the rarity score. "

So to deal with this we currently only consider the first 512 words in an essay. To improve this, we could split an essay into chunks, grade each individual chunk and then average the grades. Another way we could improve the model would be to include more training data. There is additional data available from a similar Kaggle competition that we could try to leverage. Lastly, there is clearly a lot of room for better feature engineering. With more knowledge of NLP we could try to build features that might improve grading in categories other than vocabulary.  "
